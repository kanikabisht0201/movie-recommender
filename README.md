Movie Recommender System
Overview
This Movie Recommender System uses machine learning techniques to recommend similar movies based on user input. The application fetches movie data and posters from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, providing users with an interactive interface to explore movie recommendations.

Features
Movie Recommendations: Select a movie from the dropdown menu to receive a list of similar movie recommendations.
Poster Images: View the posters of the recommended movies fetched from the TMDb API.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit, allowing for easy deployment and interaction.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit requests
Download the necessary data files (movie_list.pkl and similarity.pkl) and place them in the same directory as the script.

Usage
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the Movie Recommender System.

Type or select a movie from the dropdown menu, then click the Show Recommendation button to view similar movie recommendations.

How It Works
The application uses a dataset of movies, which includes their titles and IDs, and a precomputed similarity matrix.
When a user selects a movie, the application identifies similar movies based on the cosine similarity of their features.
It fetches the poster images of the recommended movies using the TMDb API and displays them alongside the movie titles.
API Key
To use the TMDb API, you must have an API key. You can obtain one by signing up at The Movie Database.
